## organising the programs
  + the api/declarations reside in a .h file with proper function description/documentation
  + the implementation resides in a .c file
  + keep the line as long as possible, don't break things where not neccessary.

## good programming habbits
  + always free after malloc, then use malloc to check for leaks
  + function declaration and implementation order should match in header and source file.
  + don't use typedefs where not neccessary.

## coverage
  + binary trees (normal/avl/others)
  + linked lists (single/double)
  + stack, heap and queue
  + matrix
  + trie and hashmap
